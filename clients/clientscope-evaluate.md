# Client Scopes - Evaluate tab

In the new design, the layout of Evaluate remains 80% the same as the old one. The biggest change is we removed the Evaluate button, and made the page to display everything at default.

The lower part of the page will remain the same as the old console in terms of functionality. Only little changes in the tab’s format. We used a right-side nav to let users navigate among the options.


## Layout improvements

* One page format
* Right side menu for the lower part of the scope mapping
* The lower part will be showing on the first landing on Evaluate page

## Function improvements

* Using multiple selector component of PF4 to choose scopes, when in selecting editing mode, looks like below:

* ‘Generated Access token’ still appears but remains empty state when there’s no user’s selected.

* ‘Effective role scope mappings’ table only shows granted roles
